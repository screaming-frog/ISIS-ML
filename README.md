# ISIS-ML

Summer research project done for the ISIS Neutron and Muon Source at the Rutherford Appleton Labs. Takes in neutron reflectometry data and gives initial estimates of key parameters for use in further finetuning with genetic algorithm. Packaged up with a nice GUI for easy use by researchers on the beamlines.
